# Certificate-Of-Occupancy

In New York City, residential buildings require a document called the Certificate of Occupancy (CO) before the building can be legally occupied by residents. For new buildings,obtaining this document can often be riddled by delays and setbacks, leading to uncertainty of when new residents can move in. Such delays can last from weeks to months, even stretching to years, during which time prospective residents are left without housing. Moreover, estimates on timelines can be inaccurate, especially when they are based on guesswork as opposed to data. 

All data is from NYC Open data as of April, 2024.
